# Creating an Admin User in Supabase

Since there's no admin@example.com user in the Authentication system, we need to create one:

## Method 1: Using the Supabase Authentication UI

1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to "Authentication" â†’ "Users" (you're already there based on your screenshot)
2. Click the "Add user" button in the top-right corner
3. Fill in the following details:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`
   - (Optional) Display name: `Admin User`
4. Click "Create user"

## Method 2: Using SQL to Sync the Database

After creating the user in Authentication, you'll need to make sure the user has admin privileges in your application database:

1. Go to the "SQL Editor" in Supabase
2. Run the following query to add admin role to the newly created user:

```sql
-- Get the UUID of the newly created admin user
SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';

-- Use the UUID from above to update or insert into your users table
INSERT INTO users (auth_id, email, first_name, last_name, role, is_active)
VALUES (
  'UUID_FROM_ABOVE', -- Replace with the actual UUID
  'admin@example.com',
  'Admin',
  'User',
  'admin',
  true
);

-- If the user already exists in your users table, update instead:
-- UPDATE users
-- SET role = 'admin', is_active = true
-- WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';
```

## Testing the Admin User

After creating the user:

1. Try logging in to your application at https://barbachli.vercel.app/login with:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`

2. Verify you have admin privileges by accessing admin-only sections of your site

## Alternative: Using an Existing User

If you prefer to use one of your existing users (like one of your Ghassen Kharrat accounts), you can:

1. Update the role of that user to 'admin' in your database
2. Reset the password if needed using the "Reset password" option in the Authentication UI
