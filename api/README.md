# Mock API Endpoints

This directory contains mock API endpoints for your application.

## Missing Endpoints
The following endpoints were missing from both Vercel and Backend APIs:
- `/auth/login`
- `/auth/check`
- `/auth/profile`
- `/auth/register`
- `/banner`

## Usage Instructions
1. These files can be deployed directly to Vercel as API routes
2. Alternatively, you can use them in a local Next.js server:
   - Create a Next.js app with `npx create-next-app@latest`
   - Copy these files to the `pages/api` directory
   - Run the development server with `npm run dev`
