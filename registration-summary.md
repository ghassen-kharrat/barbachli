# User Registration Summary

## Test Results

1. **Direct User Registration**
   - Attempted to register a new user via Vercel API and direct backend API
   - All registration attempts failed with "email rate limit exceeded" error
   - This is likely a security measure from Supabase to prevent spam/abuse

2. **Test Account**
   - Successfully logged in with test account via Vercel API
   - Credentials: 
     - Email: `test@example.com`
     - Password: `Password123!`
   - The token received is labeled as a "mock-test-jwt-token-for-testing-purposes-only"
   - This suggests the Vercel API is using mock data for testing

3. **Backend API**
   - The test account does not work with the direct backend API
   - Login attempt returns "Invalid login credentials" error
   - This confirms that the test account exists only in the Vercel API's mock data

## Conclusions

1. Creating a new user in the database is currently not possible due to rate limits in Supabase's authentication system.

2. For testing purposes, you can use the existing test account:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `Password123!`

3. The test account will work with the Vercel-hosted frontend but not with direct backend API calls.

4. To register a real user in the database, you would need to:
   - Contact Supabase support to address the rate limit issue
   - Implement a different authentication method
   - Or use the Supabase dashboard to create users manually

## Recommendation

For now, use the test account for development and testing purposes. When ready to deploy to production, you may need to reconfigure the authentication system or contact Supabase support regarding the rate limits.
